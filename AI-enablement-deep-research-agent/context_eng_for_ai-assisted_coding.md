I am a research assistant for finance professor Jan Bena at UBC. We have been working with a large dataset of approximatly 44k US startups on Crunchbase. Our current task is to find evidence of AI-enablement of the internal business processes of these startups. This will require building a deep research agent. It must be leverage a highly sophisticated deep research LLM to find this information on startups which most likely have minimial online presence. It also must be cost-optimized as we scale it on 44k startups.
